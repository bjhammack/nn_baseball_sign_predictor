This file will show all available commands in the program, what they do, and what you need to do to properly run the entire thing.

Assuming you have all prerequisites, copy/pasting this code into your python console should run the program in its entirety.

# create training data
sm = ttsg.Sign_Maker() # initialized object for creating training data
train_data = sm.create_train_data() # creates numpy array of n number of signs. Takes optional argument for how many rows you want (default: 100,000).

# data analysis prior to modeling
analysis = da.Analytics(train_data) # initialize object that holds all analytical functions
analysis.data_overview() # provides overview of your training data (longest signs series, mean length, std, counter per label, etc.)

# logistic regression model
lr_model = logreg.Model(train_data) # initializes object to run logistic regression
lr_model.init_lr() # sets initial params of model, plus splits data into train/test
score, predictions = lr_model.fit_data() # fits data to model and tests against test data. Returns score of test data and raw predictions for test data.
lr_model.plot_confusion_matrix(score, predictions) # generates confusion matrix from the test data

# neural network model
nn_model = nn.Model(train_data) # inits object to run neural network
nn_model.init_network() # sets initial params of network, including layers, and train/test splits data
history = nn_model.fit_data() # fits data to model and tests against test data. Returns model to use for prediction
nn_model.plot_loss(history) # plots graph of loss over each epoch
nn_model.plot_accuracy(history) # plots graph of accuracy over epochs

# random forest model
rf_model = rf.Model(train_data) # inits object to run random forest
